Hi, I’m Fredy, a developer and musician based in Berlin.

I build cross platform apps with Flutter and Supabase, and websites with React/Next.js and Tailwind. I’m especially interested in the mechanisms that shape how people perceive and create reality, through both a technical and a metaphysical lens. To me, software and the human intellect share the same language: patterns, logic, loops, problem solving.

Synced (www.synced.world) is my latest project, an app exploring new communication rituals through real-time interaction and playful constraints. I’m always open to collaborations around Synced, whether you want to contribute directly, explore an idea together, or simply connect and see how we can support each other. If Synced resonates with you and you’d like to be involved in any way, feel free to reach out.

For client work, I run my studio Synesthesigns (www.synesthesigns.com), where I craft tailored websites.

Besides colored symbols in VS Code, I’m into music production, writing, frisbee, snowboarding, and just living life in the streets and parks.
