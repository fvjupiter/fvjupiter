- 👋 Hi, I’m Fredy, 26 y.o., Web-Developer & Musician based in Berlin, Germany.
  Since I was a child I am interested in understanding the world, solving problems and creating ideas to improve, rethink
  and rebuild current systems. Especially the human conciousness and its similarities to software, e.g. the
  possibility to develop flexible, weightless concepts, I find pretty fascinating.
  I made the experience that both can be (more or less) easily programmed and changed to whatever you can imagine 
  and will then take their (more or less great) impact on the world ;-)
