- 👋 Hi, I’m Fredy, a Web-Developer & Musician based in Bremen, Germany.
  Since I was a child I am interested in understanding the world, solving problems and creating ideas to improve, rethink
  and rebuild current systems. Especially the human conciousness and its similarities to software, e.g. the
  possibility to develop flexible, weightless concepts, I find pretty fascinating.
  I made the experience that both can be (more or less) easily programmed and changed to whatever you can imagine 
  and will then take their (more or less great) impact on the world.
- 👀 I’m interested in
  - developing progressive / efficient Web-Apps, functionalities & reusable components
  - designing simple, intuitive user-interfaces & fast loading webpages with finetuned user-experience
- 💻 Till now I'm working with 
  - React (*since* mid 2019) (before: HTML, JS, CSS, jQuery late 2018)
  - Next.js as the react-framework of choice (early 2020) (before: create-react-app)
  - Recoil.js for state-management (mid 2021)
  - core CSS, Sass (late 2018) & Tailwind (late 2021) for styling
  - Framer Motion for animations (early 2021)
  - Node js for the backend (early 2021)
  - Firestore for authentication, realtime data and storing content (early 2021)
  - Contentful as a cms (end 2021)
- 🌱 I’m currently
  - learning how to use git (and fill up my codebase)
  - create parallax effects
  - getting used to strapi as a cms, and typescript instead of javascript (for larger projects)
  - coding an application for online competitions...
  - checking out different database-systems
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on progressive ideas in the field of web-development as well as projects to earn some money ;-)
