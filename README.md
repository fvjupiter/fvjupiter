Hi, my name is Fredy. I'm a programmer based in Berlin, Germany.

Mainly I worked with JS-Frameworks for the frontend and cloud services for backend purposes. Currently my passion lies in the development of cross-platform networks with Flutter and Supabase.
Besides coloured symbols and numbers in VSC I'm into music production, writing, playing frisbee, snowboarding and just living life. It feels natural to me to solve problems, find efficient solutions and recognise patterns. I see a lot of parallels between software and the human mind which makes both areas even more fascinating. Check out "Prometheus Rising" by Robert Anton Wilson if you like to dig deeper on that.
