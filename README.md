Hi, my name is Fredy. I'm a Software-Dev based in Berlin, Germany.

Besides coloured symbols and numbers in VSC I'm into music production, philosophy, self-development, writing, playing frisbee, snowboarding and understanding the principles of human beings. I'm easy-going with people, know how to talk, communicate and stay calm and balanced most of the time. It feels natural to me to solve problems, find efficient solutions and connect single parts of a bigger picture. I see a lot of parallels between software and the human mind which makes both areas even more fascinating. Made the experience that these can be (more or less) easily programmed, changed to whatever you can imagine and will eventually take their (more or less great) impact on the world ;)
