Hi, I’m Fredy, a developer, musician, and free spirit based in Berlin.

I build cross platform apps with Flutter and Supabase, and modern web experiences with React/Next.js and Tailwind. I’m especially interested in the mechanisms that shape how people perceive and create reality, through both a technical and a metaphysical lens. To me, software and the human mind share the same language: patterns, logic, loops, identity.

I’m the creator of Synced (www.synced.world), a real time app exploring new communication rituals through real time interaction and playful constraints. I’m always open to collaborations around Synced, whether you want to contribute directly, explore an idea together, or simply connect and see how we can support each other. If Synced resonates with you and you’d like to be involved in any way, feel free to reach out.

For client work, I run my studio Synesthesigns (www.synesthesigns.com), where I craft tailored websites with both - soul and technical precision.

Besides colored symbols in VS Code, I’m into music production, writing, frisbee, snowboarding, and generally following curiosity.
